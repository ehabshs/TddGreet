## FAQ

* **Why do we need this change?** Currently our bower projects are pointed to release and consume from the registry stored in the austin servers which will be deprecated by the end of December 2017.

* **What is `bower-art-resolver`?** It is a custom Bower resolver dedicated to allow integration of Bower with (jfrog) Artifactory. Note that resolvers are supported in **Bower versions >= 1.5**.

* **I got the following error `ENORESOLVER Bower resolver not found: bower-art-resolver`** make sure that `bower-art-resolver` is defined in your `package.json` and run `npm install`.
